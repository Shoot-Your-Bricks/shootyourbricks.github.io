			<p class="title-p">Why the Name?</p>
			<p>Shoot Your Bricks is the name of my LEGO YouTube channel (shooting bricks with a camera). 
				The YouTube channel was my first major presence on the internet, 
				and I still use the name to this day in other internet contexts. 
				My real name is Luke, but sometimes I'm called by my nickname, Gunford, 
				which is another reference to my YouTube channel (Gunford was a character that drove a cool LEGO car and caught bad guys).</p>
