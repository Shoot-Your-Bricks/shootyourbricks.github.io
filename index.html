				<p id="name-paragraph">Shoot Your Bricks is the name of my LEGO YouTube channel (shooting bricks with a camera). 
					The YouTube channel was my first major presence on the internet, 
					and I still use the name to this day in other internet contexts. 
				</p>
				<br> 
				<p id="name-paragraph">My real name is Luke, but sometimes I'm called by my nickname, Gunford, 
					which is another reference to my YouTube channel (Gunford was a character that drove a cool LEGO car and caught bad guys).
